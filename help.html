These liquidity pool&nbsp; release a special kind of token (Liquidity Tokens), that are the Animals. Thus, Animals value are tied to liquidity. Since liquidity in Goldeneggs Dapp is locked by default, Animals value tend to remain quite stable.<br>Magical Farms (Gnomes, Fairies, Dragons) are acquired by spending Tokens (GLDE or GLDI), those Tokens are locked forever in the farm contract (burned). Thus, Magical Entities (Gnomes, Fairies, Dragons) value is tied to the Tokens value. Since GLDE and GLDI price depend exclusively from supply and demand (how the community interact with the tokens), their value tend to be more volatile and much less stable compared to Animals (LP tokens) value.<br><br>

                              <li><strong>What do Golden Peacock and Golden Toucan do?<br></strong><br>Golden Peacock and Golden Toucan are the NFT (non functional token) of GoldenEggs ecosystem!<br>There is only ONE Peacock and ONE Toucan, and they can only have one owner per time.<br>Anytime the Peacock or Toucan is bought, 90% of trx spent by the new owner goes to refund the previous owner! The rest of trx are used for provide liquidity to GLDI or GLDE.<br>Anytime a new owner buy the Peacock or Toucan, its price increase of +15%!<br>Everyday the price decrease of -1.5%.<br>Peacock and Toucan produces GLDI and GLDE every day for their owners.<br><br></li><li><strong>Governance and "Farmocracy"
<br><br></strong>GoldenEggs is a community oriented project, every evolutionary step made in development (examples: create a new farm, increase/decrease tokens production of farms, create a new mini-game, etc) is voted and decided by community. "Farmocracy" (farmers democracy) consist on the community voting act, on the official goldeneggs telegram group, where from time to time users are called to vote (polls) on future directions of the ecosystem.<br><br></li><li><strong>How can I make profit and how much?<br></strong><br>In every Farm page, you can see detailed real-time stats such as Daily ROI%, APR (yearly profit %), etc. You can sell your GLDE and GLDI in the <a href="dex.html" class="text-primary">Golden DEX</a>, or in Justswap&nbsp; by clicking the buttons "TRADE" in the <a href="index.html" class="text-primary">main </a>page for each token, and easily convert them for TRX, USDT, or any other asset you can think of.<br><br></li><li><strong>Free Energy<br></strong><br>Every transaction in the Tron blockchain consumes "energy" (please visit the official Tron websites to learn more on how Tron cryptocurrency works), although energy costs are extremely cheap (compared to other cryptos), GoldenEggs ecosystem have two energy community-pools to help users in getting free energy when interacting with farms smartcontracts, one pool is dedicated to Penguins farm (that aim to be 100% energy-free for its farmers), the other pool is shared among all other farms (since there are many users and many farms, not everybody might get free transactions all the time, but still it's a big help).<br><br></li><li id="gldei"><strong>What are GLDI and GLDE?<br></strong><br>Golden Eggs (GLDE) and Golden Diamonds (GLDI) tokens are the official GoldenEggs Ecosystem utility tokens.<br>They are inflationary by nature, every day new tokens are produced in the farms and given to farmers, forever. The supply is potentially unlimited, and the daily produced amount can vary from time to time (farmocracy).<br>The main use case (utility) of GLDI and GLDE tokens is to allow farmers to generate profits by claiming (rewards) them and converting them to other assets (trx, usdt, btc, eth, etc.), or reinvesting them (compound) in order to gain even&nbsp; bigger profits in the future.&nbsp;<br>GLDI and GLDE value is completely decentralized and governed by supply and demand forces, their prices go up whenever they are bought, and go down whenever they are sold.<br><br></li><li id="glds"><strong>What are GLDS?</strong><br><br>Golden Shells (GLDS) are the official Deflationary tokens of GoldenEggs Ecosystem!<br>They are designed to be a strong store of value, there is no inflation, no production/minting, and the small supply is designed to shrink over time.<br>Every time a person buy/sell/transfer GLDS, 5% of such transfer is burned.<br>Burn allocation: 2% is sent to a special GLDS fund (more info on this below), 0.5% is given to marketing fund, 2.5% is destroyed and removed from supply forever (shrinking supply!).<br>The official way to interact with Golden Shells (GLDS) is to just buy and hold them, their value will naturally grow over time, no need to do anything!<br>Golden Shells (GLDS) can be acquired via Justswap, using any other token (trx, glde, gldi, usdt, btc, eth, etc.).</li><li id="glds"><strong>"Special GLDS Fund"?<br><br></strong>Part of the burned GLDS tokens are sent to this special fund. This fund will use them in 2 ways:<br><br>- Add them to Justswap Liquidity Pool among with TRXs: to make GLDS market more stable and strong.<br><br>- Send GLDS to future GLDS farms: since GLDS cannot be minted, farms that "produce" them needs to be refilled by the GLDS Fund.<br><br></li><li><strong>How the Daily Lottery GLDI works?<br></strong><br>Every day a lucky ticket is selected and win the prize! The more tickets you have = the bigger chances to win!<br><span style="font-size: 1.15rem;"><br><br>Additional Terms and Conditions in the about section</span></li>

Golden Eggs tokens can be bought and sold at any time, and they can be also used to farm additional tokens (magical farms).<br><br>Funds allocation (Animal farms): 5% to marketing, 5% to referral (referral program), 90% to staking.
